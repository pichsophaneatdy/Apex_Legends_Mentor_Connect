## Introduction

Apex Legends Mentor Connect is a web application built during a 24-hour hackathon in collaboration with Electronic Arts. The project focuses on enhancing gamers' interaction, specifically in one of the most popular game Apex Legends. Apex Legends Mentor Connect, integrated into the Apex Legends website, aims to connect mentors with mentees, providing guidance and support to new players in order to help them enhance their skills quickly.

## Key Features

- **Mentor-Mentee Connection:** The web app facilitates connections between experienced players (mentors) and new players (mentees), enabling mentorship and skill development.

- **Enhanced Skill Development:** Mentees can benefit from personalized guidance, tips, and strategies provided by mentors, helping them navigate the complexity of the Apex Legends game more effectively.

- **Verified Coaches:** Mentors receive a verified badge, ensuring mentees that they are receiving guidance from trusted and experienced players.

- **Incentives for Mentors:** To incentivize mentors, they are rewarded with free skins and in-game currency as a token of appreciation for their dedication and support.

## Data-driven Approach

To support the development of the web app, our team of data scientists has conducted extensive research and analysis. The data collected indicates a significant demand for assistance among Apex Legends players, highlighting the need for a platform like Apex Legends Mentor Connect.

By leveraging this data, we aim to create a solution that addresses the specific pain points and challenges faced by new players in the game. The insights gained from the data analysis form the foundation of our web app's features and functionalities.

## Collaboration and Development

The project follows a collaborative development approach using Agile methodology. We have adopted Agile principles to ensure effective teamwork, continuous improvement, and efficient delivery of features. Our collaboration process includes the following:

- **Sprints:** We work in short sprints, typically one to two weeks long, to plan, develop, and review specific features and functionalities. This iterative approach allows us to deliver value incrementally and gather feedback along the way.

- **Daily Standups:** We conduct daily standup meetings to sync up, discuss progress, and identify any blockers. This helps us stay aligned as a team and address any challenges or dependencies promptly.

- **User Stories and Backlog:** We maintain a backlog of user stories, representing features and tasks that need to be implemented. These user stories are prioritized based on their value and complexity, ensuring that we work on the most critical and feasible items first.

- **Collaborative Tools:** We utilize collaborative tools such as Git, GitHub, and project management platforms (e.g., Trello, Jira) to track progress, manage tasks, and facilitate seamless communication among team members.
